## Additional Materials

A main resource for the material from today's workshop is my DID chapter in the *Handbook of Labor, Human Resources, and Population Economics*.  The published (gated) version is available [here](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_352-1).   The (ungated) draft version is available [here](https://bcallaway11.github.io/files/Callaway-Chapter-2022/main.pdf).
